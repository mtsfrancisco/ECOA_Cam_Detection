To run in an environment:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install the independencies necessary through the use of pip 
    and the req.txt file given
- If tkinter isnt installed run the following outside of the 
    venv environment -> brew install tkinter
- You will have to check if versions of python3 and tkinter 
    match
- To run use f5 while in the PeopleCounter.py file or...
    ... use the Python + directory to run the program

To run within the .exe
- To create the .exe simply run pyinstaller PeopleCounter.spec
- It may take up to 15 minutes for the .exe to compile and
    be ready for use
- Once compiled simply head to the dist/ folder created and
    double click on the resulting .exe file to run the program
- If it takes a while for the program to start, this is normal
    behavior as opening it does indeed take a delay to start
    due to packages/libraries installed
