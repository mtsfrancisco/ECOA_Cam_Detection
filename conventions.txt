Basics:
    - classe: CamelCase
    - variables, functions and methods: snake_case
    - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

Space within code:
    - Indent using 4 spaces (tabs).
    - (Tabbing should be the same as this file)
    - Limit lines to 79 characters.
    - Use blank lines to separate classes and functions.

Naming Files:
    - When consists of class use CamelCase
    - Any other situation use underline and lowercase

Git:
    - When using git it would be ideal to use seperate
        branches and then use checkout to finish and switch
    - When ending day commit message should summarize
        what the individual had achieved that day
    - General commits should consist of what changes one 
        has made to individual folder/files
